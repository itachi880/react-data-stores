# React data stores

A simple state management solution that allows you to create a centralized stores for your application. This package provides a `Store` class to manage state and listen for changes.

## Installation

You can install this package via npm:

```bash
npm install react-data-stores
```

## Usage

### Creating a Store

You can create a new store instance by passing an initial state to the `Store` class.

```javascript
import Store from "react-data-stores";

const dataStore = new Store({ counter: 0 });
```

### Accessing State

To access the current state of the store, use the `getState` method.

```javascript
const currentState = dataStore.getState(); // { counter: 0 }
```

### Updating State

You can update the state using the `setState` method. This method takes an object containing the new state values.

```javascript
dataStore.setState({ counter: 1 });
```

### Subscribing to State Changes

You can listen for state changes by subscribing to the store. The `subscribe` method takes a callback function that will be called whenever the state changes. and you have to pass a setter as the callback to make the component respond to state changes

> the `subscribe` methode return the `unsubscribe` methode wich do what it named unsubscribe the component from notifications about the state update

```javascript
const unsubscribe = dataStore.subscribe((newState) => {
  console.log("State updated:", newState);
});

// To unsubscribe
unsubscribe();
```

### Example in real use case

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `Store` class in a React component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { dataStore } from "./dataStore"; // Import your Store instance

export default function CounterComponent() {
  //get the current state of the store
  const [data, setData] = useState(dataStore.getState());

  useEffect(() => {
    //you have to subscribe this component to the store envents to benefit from the ui updates if the data on the store change

    //and to subscribe you can pass any call back function but the ui will not update unless you subscribe with a setter
    const unsubscribe = dataStore.subscribe(setData);
    return () => {
      unsubscribe();
    };
  }, []);
  //the reason you have to use use effect is you want the unsubscribe to happen after the unmount of the component (for performence and avoiding errors)
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => dataStore.setState({ counter: data.counter + 1 })}>
        {/*up to this far the onclick event will inform any 
            component that is subscribe to the store changes  that the 
            state has been change and what the change is*/}
        Increase {data.counter}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Navigator : static property

> you may encounter `navigator` property whene using stores it's just and feature that take a navigator function that use to manage routing in react and use it anywhere and it's a static property in the Store by default it is a void function but you can assigne it any time

### example

```javascript
import Store from "react-data-stores";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
export default function X() {
  Store.navigator = useNavigate();
  return <p>hello</p>;
}
```

> now any where in your app you can use this navigator methode by importing the class and call navigator from it
